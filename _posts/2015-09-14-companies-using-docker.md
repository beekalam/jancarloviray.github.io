Going with the flow of "companies using [insert tech]", here are the companies using Docker. Big companies with the need for scalable and distributed systems seem to have adopted docker. Though there are many critics talking about Docker not being production-ready, I am impressed to find that a global financial service corportation such as [ING](http://blog.docker.com/2014/12/dockercon-europe-keynote-continuous-delivery-in-the-enterprise-by-henk-kolk-ing/) using Docker containers to drive 500 deployments a week.

In addition, Goldman Sachs, a global investment bank uses Docker containers to [centralize application builds and deployments](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/business/a-small-software-company-sees-a-future-in-containers-of-code.html?_r=2). For all the critics out there, here's a [myth busting article](http://www.cloudtp.com/2015/02/26/myth-busting-docker-six-reasons-why-the-containerized-future-is-closer-than-you-think/) revolving around Docker's supposed "flaws".
