### 2015

The traditional "first!" on this blog. Quite a rebirth from my other blogs. This time, it will be a focus on my career in development and possibly (ultimate goal), entrepreneurship. This year 2015 should be a good year.

### Full Stack Agile DevOps Engineer

Quite a lot of buzzwords! In fact, it is a title that does not even exist. I'm currently Senior Front-End Developer, but I am transitioning towards the title for myself personally and hopefully start getting some traction towards building a lean startup. Lots of ideas, very little time.

I believe being "Agile" in every area and processes is the way to survive and thrive in this fast-paced world. Almost every industry is moving doubly faster every year and innovation is everywhere. Execution must adapt to the continually changing world and requirements.
