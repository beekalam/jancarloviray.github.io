Hopefully, you have enjoyed some of the articles I posted here throughout the years. I geared it more as a personal reference for myself and yet, it has gained a good amount of views. At this point, I will be refocusing and rebranding this blog into topics like entrepreneurship, product creation and growth, as this is now my main focus. Until then, this blog will be under construction. 

Future topics include: 
- "How to properly market-validate your idea?"
- "How to go from idea to product?"
- "Don't write a line of code before you do these things"
