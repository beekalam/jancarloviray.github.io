I am quite impressed at the adoption of React.js (it is not 1.0 yet!). From my search and experience working with both, as well as networking within the field, I personally see that (with exceptions) **Angular.js is the de-facto framework chosen by early startups** while **React.js is the de-facto framework chosen by more established companies/startups**. Personally, I love both. *I find Angular.js more fun to work with (at the cost of occasional frustrations), while I find React.js more peaceful and less stressful framework to work with, though at the cost of more typing and boilerplate code to write*
