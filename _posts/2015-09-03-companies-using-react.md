I am quite impressed at the growth of companies using React.js (even though it is not 1.0 yet!). I have been delving deep into React.js within a huge public-facing platform and in my curiosity, I searched companies that are using React.js. It seems that established companies have migrated to React.js compared to small startups that somewhat prefer Angular.js much more. Here is a small list of companies that I know are using React.js. My conclusion from my experience in the field is that (with exceptions, of course) **Angular.js is almost the de-facto framework chosen by early startups** while **React.js is the de-facto framework for more established companies/startups**. Personally, I love both. *I find Angular.js more fun to work with (at the cost of occasional frustrations), while I find React.js more peaceful and less stressful framework to work with.*
