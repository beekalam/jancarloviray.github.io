I am quite impressed at the growth of companies using React.js (it is not 1.0 yet!). I have been delving deep into the library within a huge public-facing platform. In my curiosity, I searched "companies that are using React.js" and I noticed that more established companies have migrated to React.js compared to small startups somewhat prefering Angular.js. Here is a small list of companies that I know are using React.js. My conclusion from my experience working with both, as well as networking within the field, is that (with exceptions) **Angular.js is the de-facto framework chosen by early startups** while **React.js is the de-facto framework chosen by more established companies/startups**. Personally, I love both. *I find Angular.js more fun to work with (at the cost of occasional frustrations), while I find React.js more peaceful and less stressful framework to work with, at the cost of more typing and boilerplate code to write*
